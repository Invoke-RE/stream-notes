# Invoke RE Stream Notes

This repository publishes notes from our Invoke RE streams at [https://twitch.tv/InvokeReversing](https://twitch.tv/InvokeReversing). Past stream recordings can also be found at our YouTube channel [https://www.youtube.com/@InvokeReversing](https://www.youtube.com/@InvokeReversing). These notes include malware functionality documentation, Yara rules and automation that we've written to assist during our analysis with IDA Pro and Binary Ninja.
